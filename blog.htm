<h1 align="center">Week One</h1>

<pre class="text" align="center">
For this genuis hour project I chose to make a website from scratch only using HTML and CSS. 
The first day, I started researching and thinking about what I wanted the website to look like. 
But of course It looks nothing like it. One of the first problems I ran into was that I didn't 
know how to position the buttons. After a few days of researching, I figured it out and am 
working on making the blog and about pages.</pre>

<h1 align="center">Week Two</h1>

<pre class="text" align="center">
This week was the week. I added and changed alot of things. Now there is a button that takes 
you to a page with random images. I am also working on a logo button that takes you back to the 
main page. I tried to see if I could put a flash game on there but it looked way to complicated.
